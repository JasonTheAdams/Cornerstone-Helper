## What is this?
This is a helper plugin designed to work alongside the [Cornerstone](http://codecanyon.net/item/cornerstone-the-wordpress-page-builder/15518868) plugin for WordPress.

## Why make it?
Cornerstone comes with a suite of elements, but they're not every possibility, which is fine. If you install this plugin and run it, then it will automatically add a list of new elements to be used. In short, to make an awesome plugin a bit more awesome.

## How do I contribute?
Make an Issue or, even better, a Pull Request. We'll look it over and, so long as it's not too use-case specific and is well written, then we'll add it in! Since there's a standard on how to add elements to Cornerstone set by them, this should be pretty straightforward. Just look in /elements to see how it works!
